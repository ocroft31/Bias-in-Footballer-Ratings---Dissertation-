# Bias-in-Footballer-Ratings---Dissertation-
Replication package for my dissertation titled 'Racial and Nationality Bias in Subjective Evaluations: A Replication of Principe and Van Ours (2022)'.

This repository contains the R Files and Stata .do files that I used to conduct my analysis for the dissertation. No dependencies necessary; the required libraries are included within the code.

A combination of Stata and R is used due to my preference for running statistical analyses and generating graphs in R, with Stata being used for the quantile regression and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, as the libraries to run these are much better in Stata.

The data is taken from the replication package for the original paper. The repository for this original package can be found here: bit.ly/4ptdPXH
